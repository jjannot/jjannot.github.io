<h2> Software </h2>

- [`bycatch`](https://ericward-noaa.github.io/bycatch/) R package<br>
This is a repository for applications of Bayesian bycatch models, using Stan for estimation. These models fit Bayesian GLMs (with or without time varying parameters, and with or without covariates) to estimate fleet-level bycatch rates. The primary applications of these models are protected species bycatch (e.g., ESA listed birds, marine mammals, sea turtles) in the groundfish fisheries off the west coast of the USA. Data compilation and analysis is done at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) in Seattle. This is part of the [NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/).<br>

<h2> Fisheries Management </h2>

* 2020-2022 - I served on NOAA's National Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program.

* 2018-2022 - I served on a number of seabird advisory and management bodies including: NOAA's National Seabird Program Strategic Implementation Team, USFWS Short-tailed Albatross Recovery Team, Agreement on the Conservation of Albatross and Petrels, and the North Pacific Albatross Work Group.

* 2013-2022 - I was the lead scientist, in collaboration with the NOAA West Coast Regional Office, on the Pacific Fishery Management Councilâ€™s [Groundfish Endangered Species Workgroup](https://www.pcouncil.org/navigating-the-council/membership-groups-and-staff/advisory-groups/groundfish-endangered-species-workgroup/) from 2013-2022.  During this time I led the reporting of fisheries bycatch of 5 species listed on the U.S. Endangered Species Act that interact with fisheries off the U.S. West Coast: humpback whales, leatherback sea turtles, short-tailed albatross, green sturgeon, and eulachon smelt.

* 2011-2022 - I was the lead scientist reporting on the annual Pacific halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) bycatch in fisheries off the U.S. West Coast.
