The main inspiration for this website comes from [John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/). Not only did John's site come in very handy as a reasonable template for this site; John also provides some really nifty `r icon_link( icon = "fab fa-r-project", text = "functions", url = "https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.com")` that weave together R, CSS, and HTML, [useful tips](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2021-03-25-customizing-distill-with-htmltools-and-css/) on how to use them and is generous enough to share them under CC BY-SA 4.0.

Other major sources of inspiration for my site include the websites of:</br>
    - [Eric J. Ward](https://ericward-noaa.github.io/)</br>
    - [Emily Markowitz](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/template_website_cv)</br>
    - [The Distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io/index.html)</br>
    </br>
Other sources of information and inspiration surrounding the use of `r make_icon( icon = "fab fa-r-project")`, Rmarkdown and `r make_icon(icon = "fab fa-github")`, include:</br>
    - [Julia S. Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/)    
    - [Eli E. Holmes](https://eeholmes.github.io/)

And, I would be remiss not to mention the *distill* package for R:</br>
